This is where I answer some of the questions I get asked on a regular basis
regarding the NSA surveillance of my Tor server. The version history of this
document can be found at

Firstly: I am quite astonished by the fact that not a single journalist who has
contacted me has implemented any means to ensure the integrity and security of
his communication. Please consider using encryption and digital signatures for
your work.

UPDATE: I am no receiving the first couple of encrypted/signed emails.
Great!

Q 1: How old are you, what are you doing at university, what are your
professional goals?

A: I am 27 and studying computer sciences. I’d like to keep my goals and
wishes to myself.

Q 2: If everyone who uses or is interested in Tor are automatically suspect, why
should anyone still use Tor? Can you explain to my readers why it doesn't make
sense to be intimidated by these recent discoveries?

A: The data I was able to look at shows how extensive these data-grabs are.
Because of how XKeyscore and similar software works, you can't simply evade
surveillance by not using Tor. On the contrary. Instead of the two pieces of
information "Mr. John Doe is currently using Tor" and "Some Tor user is
currently watching a YouTube video" secret services will gather the single
piece of information "Mr. John Doe is currently watching a YouTube video" if
Tor is not used.

Every Tor user sends a strong message that democracy and the proliferating
surveillance of all communication are of great concern to him or her. I can only
promote campaigning for a free society.

Q 3: I am running a Tor server. Am I also under surveillance?

A: Everyone is affected by the surveillance. However, I have yet to see
proof that all relays by all supporters are targeted by XKeyscore — the
central Tor Directory Authorities are therefore in a somewhat exceptional
position.

Q 4: You are the only named victim of NSA surveillance in Germany, other than
Angela Merkel. How does that feel?

A: The kind of surveillance is very different, so I am not a big fan of this
comparison. Every German citizen is affected every day by unlawful
surveillance without anything ever being publicized. A singled out case may be
good for headlines but the incredible scale of surveillance and the absence of
adequate protection mechanisms for people with little know-how is the real
scandal here. I am shocked at how easy it is for an innocent person to
become the focus of surveillance and at the disregard for basic human
rights shown by secret services.

Without wanting to trivialize the surveillance of my own server I would like
to say that the documents made available to me show no evidence of further
surveillance of my private computer or other private aspects of my life.
However, I cannot say for certain wether these further aspects are covered by
some other part of the extensive XKeyscore program.

Q 5: One technical detail is quite interesting: The NDR (Northern German
Radio) mentioned "source code" which we cannot quite grasp. Maybe you can
tells us exactly where the IP address of your Tor server appeared?

A: The documents shown in the segment were shown to me for the duration of the
interview. That is where I saw source code in a programming language
unknown to me (with bits of C++ thrown in) which seemed to be XKeyscore
plugins. In this source code (which I consider to be of mediocre quality
because of conflicting comments, faulty data copies, etc.) I found the hard
coded IP address of my server. There were no traces of an external config
file.

Q 6: You seem to be an "extremist" in the eyes of the secret service — simply
because you want to protect your privacy and the privacy of others. How do you
feel about that?

A: The word "extremist" has never been used in direct relation to me but
people who are given this title are working, as I am, to give the world a
little bit of their freedom on the internet back. Privacy is a basic human
right, not the excentric goal of so called "extremists".

Q 7: I would like to support your work.

A: I do not want to profit personally from being under surveillance by
secret services. Support the Tor project, run a server, talk to the people in
your life about security and data protection in everyday life. Keep this
topic alive beyond today or the next couple of weeks.

Q 8: Did you ever anticipate that the NSA was be interested in your data and
information?

A: Since Edward Snowden's leaks it was clear that secret services would be
interested in the work of networks like Tor which anonymize their users. This
was made obvious by the publicized presentations. The fact that the
surveillance would include the servers regardless of actual probable cause is
something that could necessarily not be foreseen.

Q 9: How does being a target of the NSA change your personal life?

A: I feel encouraged on my path. Only through actions can we defend
democracy in the long run. Democracy needs privacy and security in
communication.

Q 10: Where did you run the server for the Tor network? The Tagesschau writes the
server ran with the IP-address 212.212.245.170 which leads to an industrial
estate in Nuremberg-Feucht. What was your role in the Tor network? Are you
going to continue being an active member?

A: The server was part of a data center in Nuremberg. Where exactly it was
located is irrelevant — users from all over the world are invited to use it for
securing their personal communication. The server is playing an exceptional role
in the Tor network as it helps administrating thousands of other
Tor-servers. This makes it one of the most worthwile targets. I will of
course continue to be an active member of the Tor network and I will keep
advocating that others follow my example.

Q 11: I was particularly surprised at how the NDR was able to find out the
address of your server and subsequently your name from cryptic data. That
means that all data which was stolen by the NSA end up being publicly
available. Or am I wrong and you contacted the media yourself?

A: The data was not cryptic but comprised of regular IP addresses. You can
easily identify a server on the internet using this information. I am not
hiding my dedication to Tor and it is not hard to find out who is behind the
server. The NDR got hold of the documents which I was later shown. I have
never initiated contact with the media.

Q 12: As an expert, can you tell us how big the iceberg under this tip really is?
How much of all data traffic is actually being monitored?

A: No, I have no further insight. However, since the content of emails is
being analyzed I have to assume almost complete and constant surveillance.

Q 13: Have you been able to verify the authenticity of the documents presented to
you by the NDR / WDR (Western German Radio)?

A: No. The documents seemed very plausible to me, the lines were numbered and
the fit the pattern of previously publicized documents. I do not know their
source and would not like to speculate on it.

Q 14: I am assuming that you are not interested in being singled out as a
person. If this is true, could you briefly explain why not?

A: I do not fully understand the question. My name is public, as is the fact
that I run a Tor server. However, the surveillance is not only aimed at me
personally but at all of society in Germany and beyond. Focussing on a
single person is missing the point.

Q 15: Am I right in thinking the documents are not "Snowden-documents"?

A: My inquiries into whether the documents originated from Edward Snowden have
not been answered. I would not like to speculate.

Q 16: What I meant by me previous question: There are probably a lot of
requests regarding your consumption of Club Mate, whether you like to go out,
etc. In other words: private things which exceed your commitment to Tor. And
I conclude from your answer that you will not respond to these requests
because this is not about a single person, as you said.

A: No, you are actually the first who has asked this. But you are right, I will
not comment on personal details.

Q 17: How did you start working on the Tor project?

A: I have been volunteering at the Tor project since 2008 because their
ideals were in line with mine and I could help directly. I have encountered a
very friendly and helpful community of people who care deeply about privacy on
the internet. I was able to contribute my knowledge of programming and
extend it in the process. Until today I am involved in the project beyond
simply running a server.

Q 18: When and how did you discover that you were being targeted by the NSA?

A: At the recording of the interview (June 6th, 2014).

Q 19: Have you felt any personal consequences of the surveillance? Are you
still able to work and travel freely, e.g. into the US?

A: I have not yet encountered any limitations. I have not been to the US in
quite some time, but I don't anticipate any problems.

Q 20: What are the most effective ways to protect oneself against this
targeted espionage?

A: In my view, Tor is the most effective technology available to us at this
point. Much more important however is a collective awareness of the problem and
respective behavior.

Q 21: If the majority of internet users employed Tor or similar networks,
would the NSA be able to cope with the amount of connections to analyze?

A: I would not like to speculate, but connection data is relatively small. It
is safe to assume that even today a huge amount of data is collected and
stored regardless of probable cause. The usefulness of this data would of
course be diminished if more people used Tor.
