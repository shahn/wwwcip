This file documents some frequently asked questions, which got asked in relation
with the surveillance of my Tor-server. The version history of this file can be

First of all: I am truly surprised, that not a single journalist has contacted
me, who has by him self proven his identity or the integrity of his
communication.

Q:
How old are you, what do you study, which career goals do you have?

A:
I am 27 years old and I study Computer Science. I'd like to keep my goals and
further wishes to myself.

Q:
If every person using or interested in Tor is tagged as being suspicious, why
should you still use Tor? Can you explain to my readers why it makes sense not
to be intimidated by these new disclosures?

A:
The data I was able to look at shows how extensive the data collection is. You
can't escape surveillance by XKeyscore or related software by not using Tor - on
the contrary, instead of the information "Mr Smith currently uses Tor" and "Some Tor
user currently watches a video on Youtube", an intelligence agency directly
reveices the information "Mr Smith currently watches a video on Youtube".

Every Tor user is sending a strong signal that he/she cares about democracy and
about the monitoring of all communication which is getting out of hand.
I can only encourage to take a stand for a free society.

Q: You now are (besides Angela Merkel) the only victim of the NSA's
surveillance program in Germany known by name. How does that feel?

A:
The level of reconnaissance is completely different, thus I do not
like this comparison. Every person in Germany is affected by unjustified
surveillance measures every day without this fact becoming apparent. This
particular case might make a great headline; the enormous scope of the
surveillance and the missing countermeasures especially for persons
unexperienced with technology are the actual scandal. I am shocked how easily
innocent persons can be targeted by surveillance and how intelligence
agencies take their course of action as granted.

Without wanting to understate the surveillance of one of my servers I would
like to mention that I could not find any evidence of further surveillance -
for example of my personal laptop - in the documents made available to
me. Of course, I can not rule out that these computers could be found in
other parts of the extensive XKeyscore program.
